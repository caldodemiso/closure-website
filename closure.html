          <div class="closure-text">
            This project focused on building a scalable, long-term homelab
            environment for myself and my family. The goal was to create a
            stable setup that supports storage, dashboards, a Minecraft server,
            and future cybersecurity and IT experiments. The project solves
            everyday problems like scattered family files, limited storage, and
            lack of centralized access. Users include myself, my husband, and my
            daughter. Main deliverables included: a HomeKit integration setup, a
            cybersecurity test environment, a self-hosted Minecraft server,
            monitoring dashboards, and a network-attached storage system.

          <div class="closure-text">
            Phase 1 of the homelab is fully complete. I met all the core
            deliverables, even though several needed major changes along the
            way. The biggest pivot was upgrading from a Raspberry Pi to a Mac
            mini and a UNAS Pro due to performance limits. The project evolved
            into something more stable, scalable, and realistic. I would rate
            the project as a strong success. Scope adjustments kept it
            manageable, and I ended with a system I can keep improving long
            after the class ends.

        <div class="closure-label">4.1 Budget Performance:</div>
        <div class="closure-text">
          The project went over the original informal budget due to the hardware
          pivot. The Mac mini and UNAS Pro were significantly more expensive
          than the Raspberry Pi. However, the cost increase added real long-term
          value and eliminated the need for replacements later.

          4.2 Schedule Performance:
        </div>
        <div class="closure-text">
          The project stayed mostly on schedule. The only delays came from
          switching hardware and reorganizing scope. Adjusting to a phase-based
          roadmap kept the timeline from falling apart.

        <div class="closure-text">
          I engaged with my two primary stakeholders, my husband and daughter,
          since they will use the storage and family dashboard the most. Their
          feedback shaped decisions on simplicity, folder structure, and
          priorities. I also communicated scope changes clearly to my instructor
          through weekly status reports. The most helpful feedback came from
          understanding what my family actually needed, not just what sounded
          cool on paper.

          Key risks included hardware limitations, project overload from too
          many deliverables, network misconfigurations, and budget creep. Some
          risks materialized like the Pi performance issue and a misconfigured
          VLAN rule. I handled them by pivoting hardware and troubleshooting
          systematically. Remaining risks include: storage expansion needs,
          future dashboard complexity, and ongoing maintenance.

              Rob contributed significantly to the network and NAS
              configuration, providing clear troubleshooting steps and practical
              automation scripts that sped up deployment. His attention to
              detail and willingness to test edge cases helped stabilize the
              environment faster than expected.

              Daniel and I talked about the homelab setup and how it fits into
              our day to day life. He said he is happy that our storage will be
              more organized and that the setup gives us room to grow later
              without having to redo everything. Even though some of the more
              advanced features are planned for the future, he is satisfied with
              what was delivered this semester.

              I checked in with Izzy and explained that the homelab will support
              things like a family Minecraft server in the future. Her reaction
              was very simple and honest. She said something like, "I like that
              we are going to have our own Minecraft server and I just want it
              to work and be fun."

          <li>
            Build a family dashboard system hosted on my homelab. It will act as
            a central hub where family members can access photos, documents,
            books, media, and shared tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop a custom document editor and e-reader so that files stored
            on the NAS can be viewed, edited, and organized directly through the
            dashboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start Phase 2 enhancements, including GPU passthrough for VM
            workloads, expanded storage automation, better monitoring
            visualizations, and a full redesign of system automations as my
            skills grow.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue upgrading the homelab hardware and architecture as needed
            so the environment becomes a long-term personal and professional
            growth platform.
