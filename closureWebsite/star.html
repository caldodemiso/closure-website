          Pivoting My Homelab When the Raspberry Pi Tapped Out

          <div class="star-text">
            At the start of the semester, I planned to run my whole homelab with
            a Raspberry Pi because it was cheap and sounded easy. Once I started
            building out the deliverables, it became super clear the Pi couldn’t
            handle the services, storage demands, or long term plans I had.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="star-field">
          <div class="star-label">Task</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            I needed to keep the project realistic and on schedule without
            letting this hardware issue kill my progress. My job was to reassess
            scope and pick a setup that would actually support what I needed.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="star-field">
          <div class="star-label">Action</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            I paused and compared my original scope with real-world performance.
            I mapped out what the Pi could actually do versus what my project
            required. I researched alternatives, considered future scalability,
            and talked with my stakeholders at home. After that, I made the call
            to upgrade to a Mac mini and a UNAS Pro. I documented the scope
            change in my project notes and adjusted my deliverables.

        <div class="star-field">
          <div class="star-label">Result</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            The pivot kept my project from falling apart. I stayed on track,
            avoided wasted time, and built a setup that will grow with me. It
            also taught me how to handle scope changes without panicking and how
            to justify decisions based on actual needs instead of sticking to
            the cheapest option.

          Using Stakeholder Input to Shape My HomeLab Features

          <div class="star-label">Situation</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            My homelab wasn’t just for me. My husband and daughter will use it
            for storage, family files, and maybe even a family dashboard. They
            had different opinions and comfort levels with tech.

        <div class="star-field">
          <div class="star-label">Task</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            I needed to figure out what they actually needed so I didn’t build a
            system that only I understood. I had to manage expectations and
            design something simple enough for them but powerful enough for long
            term use.

          <div class="star-label">Action</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            I sat down with them and asked what they’d use the homelab for. I
            used their feedback to shape my decisions about the UNAS Pro, the
            dashboard ideas, and how storage would be organized. I made sure
            everything I built could be used without them ever touching terminal
            commands. I also updated my charter and notes to reflect their
            needs.

          <div class="star-label">Result</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            My project started feeling like a real system instead of a school
            assignment. Their input helped me prioritize features that matter
            long term, and it taught me that stakeholders don’t need fancy tech,
            they need clarity and ease of use. It made my project more human.

          Tailoring My Entire Architecture After Learning the Hardware Reality

          <div class="star-label">Situation</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            My original plan assumed the Raspberry Pi would be enough for
            everything: file storage, dashboards, containers, and long term
            growth. But once I actually got into the work, I realized its
            limitations immediately.

        <div class="star-field">
          <div class="star-label">Task</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            I had to tailor my whole project to fit the actual context, not the
            fantasy plan in my head. That meant dealing with real hardware
            limits, real users, and real performance needs.

        <div class="star-field">
          <div class="star-label">Action</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            I revisited my requirements and compared them to the Pi’s CPU, RAM,
            I/O limits, and storage performance. I evaluated alternatives,
            balancing cost and longevity. The Mac mini and the UNAS Pro made the
            most sense for what I wanted to do over the next several years. I
            updated my charter, modified my deliverables, and re-scoped the
            project to align with the new architecture instead of pretending the
            old plan still worked.

          <div class="star-label">Result</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            Tailoring the project kept it realistic and achievable. Instead of
            forcing a tool that didn’t fit, I adapted the approach and used gear
            that supported long term use. I learned that tailoring isn’t “giving
            up,” it is smart project management and it makes the final system
            way more stable.

            Buying the Mac mini and UNAS Pro was not the cheap option. But cheap
            wasn’t getting me anywhere. My homelab had to serve long term family

        <div class="star-field">
          <div class="star-label">Action</div>
          <div class="star-text">
            I evaluated what mattered most: reliability, scalability,
            performance, and ease of use. I asked myself what would reduce
            headaches in the future and what my family actually needed out of
            this system. That mindset made the decision easier. The more
            expensive setup offered real value, not just faster hardware but
            less maintenance, more stability, and a better experience for
            everyone who will use it.

            I ended up with a homelab that delivers value instead of technical
            debt. This experience helped me understand that value in project
            management isn’t about price, it is about sustainability, user
            needs, and long term impact. It changed how I think about “cheap vs
            worth it.”

            When I started configuring my network segments and dashboards,
            nothing worked right. Devices weren’t showing up the way I expected
            and the VLAN rules were off.

          <div class="star-text">
            I followed a structured troubleshooting process instead of randomly
            poking at settings. I checked cables first, validated IP ranges,
            reviewed firewall rules, tested pings, and compared each
            configuration against Ubiquiti documentation. I only changed one
            thing at a time so I could trace what caused each result. I kept
            brief notes on what I tested so I didn’t loop back and repeat steps.

            consistent, careful steps. It also made me more confident working
            with network tools because I know I can debug issues without
            freaking out.
