          Three stakeholder interviews were planned for this project. Interview
          #1 was successfully completed. Interviews #2 and #3 were not conducted
          due to time constraints during the project closure phase.

          <div class="interview-label">Selection Rationale</div>
          <div class="interview-value">
            I selected Daniel because he is one of my project stakeholders, he
            knows my technical background and growth firsthand, and he has
            real-world experience with engineering, networking, and project
            management. He was able to give meaningful feedback on both the
            technical direction of my homelab and on my approach to project
            planning and execution.

        <div class="interview-field-full">
          <div class="interview-label">Conversation Summary</div>
          <div class="interview-value">
            <p>
              Daniel explained how project management has shaped both his
              professional and personal life. With a background in industrial
              engineering, he managed production lines where planning,
              alignment, and resource management were critical. He emphasized
              that project management is not just a work skill but a mindset
              that improves decision-making everywhere, including personal
              projects like home remodels. He described how breaking down large
              goals into small, manageable pieces creates clarity and prevents
              overwhelm.
            </p>

            <p>
              He then shared how he personally uses project management to
              maintain alignment with his team, identify blockers early, and
              ensure transparency. He stressed that the value of a project plan
              increases when resources are limited because planning prevents
              waste. These points connected directly to my homelab project,
              where time, budget, and hardware limitations required intentional
              planning.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, Daniel offered advice for students learning project
              management. He warned against becoming overly focused on
              tools—Jira, Monday, ClickUp—and losing sight of the purpose of
              project management. Tools support the process but should not
              dominate it. He said flexibility is essential because projects
              always evolve.
            </p>

            <p>
              He also shared hiring insights. The two qualities he values most
              in candidates are strong communication and a growth mindset.
              Strong communication ensures alignment and prevents issues from
              escalating, while a growth mindset makes someone adaptable, open
              to learning, and capable of long-term growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Daniel closed by reminding me not to overthink project planning.
              He explained that simple tools like whiteboards and sticky notes
              are often enough. What matters is clarity, simplicity, and
              momentum—not complexity.
